    <h1 class="no-bottom">How To Add A Leaderboard</h1>
    <p>It's simple to implement a leaderboard in your Code Golf post so that all users can see the results of the competition without scrolling through the whole thread.</p>
    <p>To use a leaderboard, include the following Markdown at the bottom of your post:</p>
    <textarea rows="20" cols="100" class="code" spellcheck="false" disabled="true">
# Leaderboard

You can view the leaderboard for this post by expanding the widget/snippet below. In order for your post to be included in the rankings, you need a header (`# header text`) with the following info:

* The name of the language (end it with a comma `,` or dash `-`), followed by...

* The byte count, as the last number to appear in your header.

For example, `JavaScript (ES6), 72 bytes` is valid, but `Fortran, 143 bytes (8-bit)` is invalid because the byte count is not the last number in the header (your answer will be recognized as 8 bytes - don't take advantage of this).
